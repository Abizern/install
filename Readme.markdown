# Installer for zsh configuration

This is the customised installer for zimfw/zimfw.

This has changed since the last time I forked and customised these dotfiles. Now, the support code is downloaded by a script which writes configuration directly to the zsh dotfiles.

This repository collects settings and builds them into the script.

## Installation

A little brute force, but this doesn't change a lot.

- Blitz the `.zim` and the zsh dotfiles

install with:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abizern/install/master/install.zsh | zsh
    
    
## Customization

Make changes to the templates and recompile.
